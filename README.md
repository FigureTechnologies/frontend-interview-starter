# Frontend Interview Starter

To get you started on your assignment, we've provided a simple React app. To run the app, you'll need NodeJS installed and perform the following:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

The second command will bring up a dev server with a lightweight backend and a client-side app (which you'll update). If the client subcommand doesn't run, you can instead run `npm run start:client` and `npm run start:server` in separate terminals.
